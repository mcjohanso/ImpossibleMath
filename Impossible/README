A says to S and P: I have chosen two integers x, y such that 1 < x < y and x + y <= 100.
In a moment I will inform S only of s = x + y and P only of p = xy. These announcements will be private.
You are required to determine the pair (x,y). The following conversation takes place.
    1. P says: I do not know the pair
    2. S says I knew you didn't"
    3. P says: Now I know it
    4. S says: I know it too.
Determine (x,y)
